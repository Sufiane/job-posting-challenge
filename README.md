# Job Posting Challenge

## How to start ?

You can either start the project locally or use it through the railway app.


If you want to start the project locally follow along:

run the following scripts
```
npm ci 
npm start
```

and you're all set !

## APIs
You'll find all the available API calls in the json files named: `API-calls.json`
Import this file into your [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) workspace.
You'll be able to use the API fully.

:warning:
In order to use the `translate` API you'll need to pass your [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/pro-api) API key.
